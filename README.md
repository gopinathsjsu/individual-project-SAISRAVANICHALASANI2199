# PROBLEM STATEMENT
We are going toÂ create a Marketplace program that will contain inventory information that enables customer to buy things by creating products. There are only a few objects left in the inventory. The number of things bought from each genre will be limited. If an item meets all of the criteria, the entire quantity due will be assessed, and payment information will be utilized to complete the transaction.

# DESIGN PATTERNS

1.Singleton.
2.Iterator

# Singleton : 
This design pattern is classified as a creational pattern since it gives one of the most effective ways to construct an object.This pattern utilizes a specific class that is in charge of creating an object while ensuring that only one object is created. This class provides a method to retrieve its single object, which may be accessible without having to create the class's object.The getIntance() method is called whenever a database instance is required, ensuring that just one instance of the object is reused.The Singleton pattern assures that a class alone has single instance as well as gives that instance an universal access point.The Singleton design pattern is amongst the most frequently misused. When a class must have precisely single instance, not any more, no fewer, singletons are employed. Singletons are commonly used by developers in an erroneous attempt to substitute global variables. 

# Iterator :
In the Java and.Net programming environments, the iterator pattern is a highly common design pattern. This technique is used to gain a way to sequentially access the elements of a collection object without having to know its underlying form.The iterator pattern is a type of behavioral pattern.The Iterator abstraction is at the heart of a new technology known as "generic programming." This technique aims to clearly distinguish between the terms "algorithm" and "data structure." The goal is to encourage component-based development, increase productivity, and simplify configuration management.

# STEPS TO RUN THE APPLICATION
 1.First open the file with visual studio code 
 2. Type command Javac User.java and press enter
 3. Next type java User (user is the main class)
 4. now enter the file name Sample Input File.csv
 5.Now you can see the application which has been executed
