# PROBLEM STATEMENT
We are going to create a Marketplace program that will contain inventory information that enables customer to buy things by creating products. There are only a few objects left in the inventory. The number of things bought from each genre will be limited. If an item meets all of the criteria, the entire quantity due will be assessed, and payment information will be utilized to complete the transaction.

# DESIGN PATTERNS

1.Singleton.
2.Factory

# Singleton : 
This design pattern is classified as a creational pattern since it gives one of the most effective ways to construct an object.This pattern utilizes a specific class that is in charge of creating an object while ensuring that only one object is created. This class provides a method to retrieve its single object, which may be accessible without having to create the class's object.The getIntance() method is called whenever a database instance is required, ensuring that just one instance of the object is reused.The Singleton pattern assures that a class alone has single instance as well as gives that instance an universal access point.The Singleton design pattern is amongst the most frequently misused. When a class must have precisely single instance, not any more, no fewer, singletons are employed. Singletons are commonly used by developers in an erroneous attempt to substitute global variables. 

# Factory :
The Factory Method design pattern is a creational design pattern that acts as an interface for producing objects in a superclass while allowing subclasses to choose the type of objects created. The factory design pattern is a key design pattern that is heavily utilized not just in JDK but also in many Open Source frameworks like as Spring, Struts, and Apache. The Factory Design model is predicated on the object-oriented concept of encapsulation. The Factory method produces various objects from a factory, and it encapsulates the creation code. So, rather of having object creation code on the client side, we wrap it in the Java Factory function.
